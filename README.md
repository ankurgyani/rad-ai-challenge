# How to Run the Code

You can run the code via command line 
```
python3 solution.py sample-input.txt
``` 

Running the command above would give you the expected ouput.
### Improvements

- It took a couple of hours to get the challenge done
- Decoupling team rankings logic into another function instead keeping it in `print_rankings` could help improve code maintainability.
- Could write more test cases for all other private functions as well for better code coverage and testing
